Configuration
=============

There are a few different configuration files used by MapProxy. Some are required and some are optional.

``services.yaml``
    This file configures which services and layers the proxy should offer. You can
    define from where the proxy should get which data. You can also set metadata like
    contact information for the Capabilities documents.
    
``proxy.yaml``
    This is the main configuration of the proxy. Configure which servers should be
    started, where the cached data should be stored, etc.
    
``seed.yaml``
    This file is the configuration for the ``mapproxy-seed`` tool.
    

``develop.ini`` and ``config.ini``
    These are the paster configuration files that are used to start the proxy in development or production mode.

services.yaml
-------------

All layers the proxy offers are configured in this file. The configuration uses the YAML format.


.. note:: The indentation is significant and shall only contain space characters. Tabulators are **not** permitted for indentation.

The configuration contains the keys ``service`` and ``layers``.


service
^^^^^^^

Here is an example for the ``service`` part::

    service:
        attribution:

            access_constraints: This service is intended for private and evaluation use only.
            fees: 'None'



attribution
"""""""""""

Adds an attribution (copyright) line to all WMS requests.

``text``
  The text line of the attribution (e.g. some copyright notice, etc).

md
""""
``md`` is for metadata. These fields are used for the WMS ``GetCapabilities`` responses. See the above example for all supported keys.

layers
^^^^^^

Here you can define all layers the proxy should offer. Each layer configuration is a YAML dictionary. The key of each layer is also the name of the layer, i.e. the name used in WMS layers argument. If MapProxy should use the same ordering of the layers for capability responses, you should put the definitions in a list (prepend a ``-`` before the key).
::

  layers:
    - layer1:
      option1: aaa
      option2: bbb
    - layer2:
      option1: xxx
      option2: yyy



Each configuration item contains information about the layer (e.g. name), how the layer is cached (e.g. in which SRS) and where the data comes from (e.g. which WMS-Server).

md
""""
Metadata for this layer. At the moment only ``title`` ist supported. It will be used as the human readable name for WMS layers.

param
""""""

With ``param`` you can set the parameters of the data-source and cache.

``format``
    This is the internal image format for the cache. The default is ``image/png``.

``request_format``
    This format is used to request new tiles. If the bandwidth to the WMS server is high
    (e.g. localhost or LAN) you should use ``image/tiff`` here. That prevents unnecessary
    encoding and decoding of the images. If unset ``format`` is used.

``srs``
    The spatial reference system used for the internal cache. You can define multiple SRSs
    here. One cache is created for each.::
    
        srs: EPSG:4326
          or
        srs: ['EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:900913']
 
    MapProxy supports on-the-fly transformation of requests between different SRSs. So
    it is not required to add an extra cache for each supported SRS. For best performance
    only the SRS most requests are in should be used.
    
    There is some special handling layers that need geographical and projected coordinate
    systems. If you set both ``EPSG:4326`` and ``EPSG:900913`` all requests with projected
    SRS will access the ``EPSG:900913`` cache, requests with geographical SRS will use
    ``EPSG:4326``. The distortions from the transformation should be acceptable these to cached SRS.

``res``
    The resolution for which MapProxy should cache tiles.
    For requests with no matching cached resolution the next best resolution is used and MapProxy will transform the result. There are three ways to configure the resolutions.

    
    1. A factor between each resolution. With each step the resolution is multiplied by this
    factor. Defaults to 2.
    
    2. A list with resolutions in units per pixel (degrees or meter per pixel). The units
    from the first configured ``srs`` are used.
    
    3. The term ``sqrt2``. This option is a shorthand for a resolution factor of 1.4142 (i.e.
    square root of two). With this factor the resolution doubles every second level. Compared
    to the default factor 2 you will get another cached level between all standard levels.
    This is suited for free zooming in vector-based layers where the results might look to
    blurry/pixelated in some resolutions.
        

sources
"""""""

You define the data sources of each layer here. The configuration :ref:`is explained below
<sources-conf-label>`.

attribution
"""""""""""
Overwrite the system-wide attribution line for this layer.

``inverse``
  If this option is set to ``true``, the colors of the attribution will be inverted. Use this if the normal attribution is hard to on this layer (i.e. on aerial imagery).

watermark
"""""""""""

Add a watermark right into the cached data. The watermark is thus also present in TMS or KML requests.

``text``
    The watermark text. Should be short.

``opacity``
    The opacity of the watermark (from 0 transparent to 255 full opaque).
    Use a value between 3 and 10 for unobtrusive watermarks.


.. _sources-conf-label:

sources
^^^^^^^

Every layer contains one or more sources. The sources define where the proxy should get the data for this layer. Each layer has a type.

MapProxy support the following types:

``cache_wms``
""""""""""""""

The ``cache_wms`` source passes requests to a WMS server and caches all data for further requests.

``req``
    ``req`` contains the source WMS URL and the layers.
    For transparent layers the option ``transparent`` should be set to ``'true'``.

``wms_opts``
    This option affects what request the proxy sends to the source WMS server.
    
    ``version`` is the WMS version number used for requests (supported: 1.0.0, 1.1.1, 1.3.0).
    If ``featureinfo`` is true, MapProxy will mark the layer as queryable and incoming
    `GetFeatureInfo` requests will be forwarded to the source server.

.. _supported_srs-label:

``supported_srs``
    A list with SRSs that the WMS source supports. If the layer caches data in an SRS that the source does not
    provide, MapProxy will use one of the configured `supported_srs` to request images and will then transform
    the result back to the cache SRS.
    
    If you have multiple `supported_srs`, MapProxy will use the fist projected SRS for requests in projected
    SRS, and vice versa for geographic SRS. E.g when `supported_srs` is ``['EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:31467']`` caches
    for EPSG:900913 will use EPSG:32467.
    
  ..  .. note:: For the configuration of SRS for MapProxy see `srs_configuration`_.

Minimal example::

  - type: cache_wms
    req:
      url: http://localhost:8080/service?
      layers: base

Full example::

  - type: cache_wms
    wms_opts:
      version: 1.0.0
      featureinfo: True
    supported_srs: ['EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:31467']
    req:
      url: http://localhost:8080/service?mycustomparam=42
      layers: roads
      transparent: 'true'

``cache_tiles``
"""""""""""""""

The ``cache_tiles`` source can retrieve data from existing tile servers. This source takes a
``url`` option that contains a URL template. The template format is ``%(key_name)s``. MapProxy
supports the following named variables in the URL:

``x``, ``y``, ``z``
  The tile coordinate.
``format``
  The format of the tile.
``quadkey``
  Quadkey for the tile as described in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx
``tc_path``
  TileCache path like ``09/000/000/264/000/000/345``. Note that it does not contain any format
  extension.

Additionally you can specify the origin of the tile grid with the ``origin`` option. Supported
values are ``sw`` for south-west (lower-left) origin or ``nw`` for north-west (upper-left)
origin. ``sw`` is the default.

Example::

  - type: cache_tiles
    url: http://localhost:8080/tile?x=%(x)s&y=%(y)s&z=%(z)s&format=%(format)s
    origin: ``nw``


``direct``
"""""""""""
A ``direct`` source passes all requests to the configured WMS server and does *not* cache any data.

``req``
  Defines the source WMS URL and the layers that should be requested. This is similar to
  the ``cache_wms.req`` parameter.

``supported_srs``
  A list of the SRS the source WMS supportes. Other requests for other SRS will be transformed. See ``supported_srs`` for :ref:`cache_wms.supported_srs <supported_srs-label>`.
  
Example::

  - type: direct
    req:
      url: http://servername/service
      layers: poi,roads

``debug``
"""""""""""

Adds information like resolution and bbox to the response image.
This is useful to determine a fixed set of resolutions for the ``res``-parameter.




proxy.yaml
----------

This file configures some internals of MapProxy.

``wms``
^^^^^^^

This configures the MapProxy WMS server. Here you can configure the image formats and SRS your MapProxy should offer in the WMS capabilities.

``image_formats``
  A list of image mime types. 

``srs``
  A list of supported SRS. MapProxy will only accept request for these SRS. 


``image``
^^^^^^^^^

Here you can define some options that affect the way MapProxy generates image results.

``resampling_method``
  The resampling method used when results need to be rescaled or transformed.
  You can use one of nearest, bilinear or bicubic. Nearest is the fastest and
  bicubic the slowest. The results will look best with bilinear or bicubic.
  Bicubic enhances the contrast at edges and should be used for vector images.
  
  With `bilinear` you should get about 2/3 of the `nearest` performance, with
  `bicubic` 1/3.
  
  See the examples below for results of `nearest`, `bilinear` and `bicubic`.
  
  .. image:: imgs/nearest.png
  .. image:: imgs/bilinear.png
  .. image:: imgs/bicubic.png


.. _jpeg_quality:

``jpeg_quality``
  An integer value from 0 to 100. Larger values result in slower performance,
  larger file sizes but better image quality. You should try values between 75
  and 90 for good compromise between performance and quality.

``stretch_factor``
  MapProxy chooses the `optimal` cached level for requests that do not exactly
  match any cached resolution. MapProxy will stretch or shrink images to the
  requested resolution. The `stretch_factor` defines the maximum factor
  MapProxy is allowed to stretch images. Stretched images result in better
  performance but will look blurry when the value is to large (> 1.2).
  
  Example: Your MapProxy caches 10m and 5m resolutions. Requests with 9m
  resolution will be generated from the 10m level, requests for 8m from the 5m
  level.
  
``max_shrink_factor``
  This factor only applies for the first level and defines the maximum factor
  that MapProxy will shrink images.
  
  Example: Your MapProxy layer starts with 1km resolution. Requests with 3km
  resolution will get a result, requests with 5km will get a blank response.

``cache``
^^^^^^^^^

``meta_size``
  MapProxy does not make a single request for every tile but will request a large meta-tile that consist of multiple tiles. ``meta_size`` defines how large a meta-tile is. A ``meta_size`` of ``[4, 4]`` will request 64 tiles in one pass. With a tile size of 256x256 this will result in 1024x1024 requests to the source WMS.
  
``meta_buffer``
  MapProxy will increase the size of each meta-tile request by this number of
  pixels in each direction. This can solve cases where labels are cut-off at
  the edge of tiles.


``base_dir``
  The base directory where all cached tiles will be stored. The path can
  either be absolute (e.g. ``/var/mapproxy/cache``) or relative to the
  proxy.yaml file.

``lock_dir``
  MapProxy uses locking to prevent multiple request for the same meta-tile.
  This option defines where the temporary lock files will be stored. The path
  can either be absolute (e.g. ``/tmp/lock/mapproxy``) or relative to the
  proxy.yaml file.
  
  .. note:: 
    Old locks will not be removed immediately but when new locks are created.
    So you will always find some old lock files in this directory.


``srs``
^^^^^^^

``proj_data_dir``
  MapProxy uses Proj4 for all coordinate transformations. If you need custom projections
  or need to tweak existing definitions (e.g. add towgs parameter set) you can point
  MapProxy yo your own set of proj4 init files. The path should contain a ``epsg`` file
  with the EPSG definitions.
  
  The configured path can be absolute or relative to the proxy.yaml.

.. _axis_order:

``axis_order_ne`` and ``axis_order_ne``
  The axis ordering defines in which order coordinates are given, i.e. lon/lat or lat/lon.
  The ordering is dependent to the SRS. Most clients and servers did not respected the
  ordering and everyone used lon/lat ordering. With the WMS 1.3.0 specification the OGC
  emphasized that the axis ordering of the SRS should be used. 

  Here you can define the axis ordering of your SRS. This might be required for proper
  WMS 1.3.0 support if you use any SRS that is not in the default configuration.
  
  By default MapProxy assumes lat/long (north/east) order for all geographic and x/y
  (east/north) order for all projected SRS.
  
  If that is not the case for your SRS you need to add the SRS name to the appropriate
  parameter::

   srs:
     # for North/East ordering
     axis_order_ne: ['EPSG:9999', 'EPSG:9998']
     # for East/North ordering
     axis_order_en: ['EPSG:0000', 'EPSG:0001']

.. _http_ssl:

``http.ssl``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: You need Python 2.6 or the `SSL module <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssl>`_ for this feature.

MapProxy supports access to HTTPS servers. Just use ``https`` instead of ``http`` when
defining the URL of a source. MapProxy needs a file that contains the root and CA
certificates. See the `Python SSL documentation <http://docs.python.org/dev/library/ssl.html#ssl-certificates>`_ for more information
about the format.
::

  http:
    ssl:
      ca_certs: ./certs_file

If you want to use SSL but do not need certificate verification, then you can disable it with the ``insecure`` option.
::

  http:
    ssl:
      insecure: True


``tile_creator_pool_size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This limits the number of parallel requests MapProxy will make to a source WMS. This limit is per request and not for all MapProxy requests.

Example: A request in an uncached region requires MapProxy to fetch four meta-tiles. A tile_creator_pool_size of two allows MapProxy to make two requests to the source WMS request in parallel.

``http_client_timeout``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This defines how long MapProxy should wait for data from source servers. Increase this value if your source servers are slower.

``tiles``
^^^^^^^^^

Configuration options for the TMS/Tile service.

``expires_hours``
  The number of hours a Tile is valid. TMS clients like web browsers will
  cache the tile for this time. Clients will try to refresh the tiles after
  that time. MapProxy supports the ETag and Last-Modified headers and will
  respond with the appropriate HTTP `'304 Not modified'` response if the tile
  was not changed.
